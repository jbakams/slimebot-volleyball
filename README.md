3D-volleyball it's a 3d versions of the [slimevolleygym](https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym) using [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) for the visualization. We added a dimension in the slimevolleygym environment and kept the same settings to see if agents will still be able to learn to master the game.

# Installation

## 1. Webots

Webots is open soure and multi-platform software used to simulate robots. It is friendly and doesn't have strong device requirements. [Download](https://cyberbotics.com/) and Install it from its official webesite. 

## 2. Python

Defautly Webots use the system python. However, one would prefer a virtual env create via [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

Here we are showing a setup for anaconda.
